    <h3>Fall 2018</h3>
    <p>The support lab for the Fall 2018 semester is not yet active, please check back for updates in the coming weeks! </p>

    <h3>Know your stuff? Volunteer with the Support Lab!</h3>
    <p>The Fall 2018 call for volunteers will open soon! Each semester, students depend on the support lab for help with lower level courses. The entire operation is volunteer run, so we need students like you to help out! If you're a strong computing student willing to share your knowledge, please check this space in the next couple of weeks to volunteer!</p>
